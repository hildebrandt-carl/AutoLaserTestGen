# Source Code

The source code is broken into two sections the constraints code and the robotic code. The constraints can be found under the constraints folder while the robotic code can be found in the catkin_ws.

## Constraints

The constraints folder contains three files each of which generates the block positions. More information on prerequistis for this are given in the docs folder.

## Robotic Code

The robotic code constains collision detection, world visualization, sensor visualization, frontier exploration, SLAM, and goal publisher. All of the information about installing it can be found in the docs folder. Informtion on running it can be found in the README inside the catkin_ws.
